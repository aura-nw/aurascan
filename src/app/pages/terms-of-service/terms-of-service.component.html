                  Waiver of Class Actions and Class Arbitrations. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS
                  ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A REPRESENTATIVE
                  (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PAGA) OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE,
                  AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF
                  ANY OTHER USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY. Accordingly, under the arbitration procedures outlined in this
                  section, an arbitrator shall not combine or consolidate more than one party’s claims without the
                  written consent of all affected parties to an arbitration proceeding. Without limiting the generality
                  of the foregoing, you and the Service Provider agree that no dispute shall proceed by way of class
                  arbitration without the written consent of all affected parties. If a decision is issued stating that
                  applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim
                  for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal
                  courts located in the British Virgin Islands. All other claims shall be arbitrated.
